            A world of magical fantasy, where the wonders of magic roam the world, giving rise to different races with
            different customs and beliefs; some collaborate with each other and others are mortal enemies.
        </p>
        <p class="set-text-font">
            In our special world, nothing is too crazy and the strangest things become everyday occurrences.
            Now you will encounter different races and discover what makes them so special and much more about them.

            When we experience the magical side of nature — the shimmering, incredible mystery of nature … we personify
            the dynamics as fairies.

        <p class="set-text-font">
            Like so many “imaginary” parts of childhood, there exists a tension between the world of the creative
            child and the realistic adult. At some point these things must be reconciled. But that doesn’t mean we stop
            believing! Belief in fairies isn’t only for children. Sometimes we just need to remember how to imagine.
            My children know that I believe in fairies — because I do.
