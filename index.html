    <h2 class="set-titles-font">Types of Fairies</h2>
    <div class="row">
  <div class="grid">
        <div> 
            <img src="Alven.png" style="width:100%;">
            <h4 class="set-titles-font">Alven</h4>
            <p class="set-text-font">Fairies from Holland who are attached to bodies of water: lakes, rivers, and ponds. They get inside bubbles and float along to their destination and sometimes they take the shapeshifted form of an otter. They come out in hordes on the full moon, dancing and playing in the moonlight reflected on the water. </p>
        </div>
        <div> <img src="Dryad.png" style="width:100%; margin-bottom: 13px;">
            <h4 class="set-titles-font">Dryad</h4>
            <p class="set-text-font">Originally a Greek type of tree fairy. But truly their presence is worldwide. If you listen to the trees blowing in the breeze, you’ll hear their whispers. Dryads appear as pure whisps of light that dart from tree-top to tree-top. Dryads may be the spirits who gave the name to the Celtic priesthood, Druids. </p>
        </div>
            
        <div> <img src="Jimaninos.png" style="width:100%;">
            <h4 class="set-titles-font">Jimaninos</h4>
            <p class="set-text-font">They are trooping fairies that fly in groups over Mexico particularly on holy nights of the year. When seen, they look like cupids or fat, chubby children. There are both male and female. This is where the theory of fairies being unbaptized children’s souls is perpetuated. Since the jimaninos resemble children and fly in the sky, people who see the assume they are lost children’s souls. </p>
        </div>
        <div> <img src="Knockers.png" style="width:100%;">
            <h4 class="set-titles-font">Knockers</h4>
            <p class="set-text-font">Some people don’t believe they are fairies, but frightening ghosts instead. Knockers are heard deep in the earth – in caves and mines. They’ve scared off many miners over the centuries, some that swear they’d never return to mining. Others claim knockers lead the miners to riches. Knockers have also helped lost miners find their way out. Or have aided rescue teams to caved-in miners. </p>
        </div>
        <div> <img src="Pixie.png" style="width:100%;">
            <h4 class="set-titles-font">Pixies</h4>
            <p class="set-text-font">Pixies are the most well-known type of fairy and seem to be the image most people call up when hearing the word “fairy”. Tinkerbell, the fairy in Peter Pan, is a pixie and depicts the classic piskie looks: small, winged creature with a large head and tiny body. Pixies love gardens full of flowers and are active on the Spring and Summer. They are generally helpful but incredibly mischievous. </p>
        </div>
        <div> <img src="Banshee.png" style="width:100%;">
            <h4 class="set-titles-font">Banshee</h4>
            <p class="set-text-font">This type of fairy is believed to be attached to the old noble Irish families. Her scream is heard right before someone dies, sometimes right outside the dying’s window. If you see her washing bloody shrouds in the river, it’s also a sign you or your family member will soon depart. Her presence is an omen of imminent death and therefore many people fear this type of fairy. </p>
        </div>
        <div> <img src="Chin-Chin.png" style="width:100%;">
            <h4 class="set-titles-font">Chin-Chin</h4>
            <p class="set-text-font">The chin chin kobakama is a Japanese house fairy that prefers the home to be kept clean. Specifically the floors. If it’s clean, they will bless the home. If it’s not clean and the residents are lazy, this fairy will pick on the home’s inhabitants with no regard. They look like tiny, wizened elves but are surprisingly energetic and spry.  </p>
        </div>
        <div> <img src="Callicantzaroi.png" style="width:100%;">
            <h4 class="set-titles-font">Callicantzaroi</h4>
            <p class="set-text-font"> These fairies ride on the backs of chickens and their favorite food is pork. They are ugly little men who ride in groups along with other goblins and fairies. They are active on the nights approaching winter solstice and supposedly are never seen past the twelfth night. Illustrations show them having misformed teeth, donkey ears and goat legs.  </p>
