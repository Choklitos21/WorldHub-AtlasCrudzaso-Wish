        <p class="set-text-font">
            A world of magical fantasy, where the wonders of magic roam the world, giving rise to different races with
            different customs and beliefs; some collaborate with each other and others are mortal enemies.
        </p>
        <p class="set-text-font">
            In our special world, nothing is too crazy and the strangest things become everyday occurrences.
            Now you will encounter different races and discover what makes them so special and much more about them.

            When we experience the magical side of nature — the shimmering, incredible mystery of nature … we personify
            the dynamics as fairies.
        </p>
        <p class="set-text-font">
            Like so many “imaginary” parts of childhood, there exists a tension between the world of the creative
            child and the realistic adult. At some point these things must be reconciled. But that doesn’t mean we stop
            believing! Belief in fairies isn’t only for children. Sometimes we just need to remember how to imagine.
            My children know that I believe in fairies — because I do.

                    and ponds. They get inside bubbles and float along to their destination and sometimes they take the
                    shapeshifted form of an otter. They come out in hordes on the full moon, dancing and playing in the
                    moonlight reflected on the water.

                <p class="set-text-font">Originally a Greek type of tree fairy. But truly their presence is worldwide.
                    If you listen to the trees blowing in the breeze, you’ll hear their whispers. Dryads appear as pure
                    whisps of light that dart from tree-top to tree-top. Dryads may be the spirits who gave the name to
                    the Celtic priesthood, Druids.

                <p class="set-text-font">They are trooping fairies that fly in groups over Mexico particularly on holy
                    nights of the year. When seen, they look like cupids or fat, chubby children. There are both male
                    and female. This is where the theory of fairies being unbaptized children’s souls is perpetuated.
                    Since the jimaninos resemble children and fly in the sky, people who see the assume they are lost
                    children’s souls.

                <h4 class="set-titles-font">Knockers</h4>
                <p class="set-text-font">Some people don’t believe they are fairies, but frightening ghosts instead. 
                    They tend to make a lot of noise and they are heard deep in the earth – in caves and mines. They’ve 
                    scared off many miners over the centuries, some that swear they’d never return to mining. Others
                    claim knockers lead the miners to riches. They’ve also been known to jump out and make funny faces
                    at the miners. Knockers can create mine cave-ins but have also helped lost miners find their way
                    out. Or have aided rescue teams to caved-in miners. The custom is to knock when you enter the mine
                    to let them know you’re there and doff your hat in greeting. Others feed the knockers with }
                    offerings of food.

                <h4 class="set-titles-font">Pixies</h4>
                <p class="set-text-font">Pixies are the most well-known type of fairy and seem to be the image most
                    people call up when hearing the word “fairy”. Other names for pixies include dusters, piskies,
                    grigs, pechts, and pickers. They are of Scottish and English origin. Tinkerbell, the fairy in
                    Peter Pan, is a pixie and depicts the classic piskie looks: small, winged creature with a large
                    head and tiny body. There are theories that suggest “pixie” relates to the Picts, ancient people
                    who once occupied Scotland. Pixies love gardens full of flowers and are active on the Spring and
                    Summer sabbats: Ostara, Beltane, Litha, and Lughnasadh. They are generally helpful but incredibly
                    mischievous.

                <p class="set-text-font">Callicantzaroi are malevolent goblin-type fairies in old Mediterranean and
                    Anatolian folklore. Though their malevolence is debated and their reputation may have been ruined
                    with the rise of the church. These goblins ride on the backs of chickens and their favorite food is
                    pork. They are supposedly ugly little men who ride in groups along with other goblins and fairies.
                    The Callicantzaroi are active on the nights approaching winter solstice and supposedly are never
                    seen past the twelfth night. Illustrations show the callicantzaros having misformed teeth, donkey
                    ears and goat legs. In Turkey they are equated with vampires and werewolves.

                    Her scream is heard right before someone dies, sometimes right outside the dying’s window. If you see 
                    her washing bloody shrouds in the river, it’s also a sign you or your family member will soon depart. 
                    Her presence is an omen of imminent death and therefore many people fear this type of fairy.

                    be kept clean. Specifically the floors. If it’s clean, they will bless the home. If it’s not clean
                    and the residents are lazy, this fairy will pick on the home’s inhabitants with no regard.
                    They look like tiny, wizened elves but are surprisingly energetic and spry.
