        <p class="set-text-font">
            A world of magical fantasy, where the wonders of magic roam the world, giving rise to different races with
            different customs and beliefs; some collaborate with each other and others are mortal enemies.
        </p>
        <p class="set-text-font">
            In our special world, nothing is too crazy and the strangest things become everyday occurrences.
            Now you will encounter different races and discover what makes them so special and much more about them.

            When we experience the magical side of nature — the shimmering, incredible mystery of nature … we personify
            the dynamics as fairies.
        </p>
        <p class="set-text-font">
            Like so many “imaginary” parts of childhood, there exists a tension between the world of the creative
            child and the realistic adult. At some point these things must be reconciled. But that doesn’t mean we stop
            believing! Belief in fairies isn’t only for children. Sometimes we just need to remember how to imagine.
            My children know that I believe in fairies — because I do.

                <p class="set-text-font">Fairies from Holland who are attached to bodies of water: lakes, rivers,
                    and ponds. They get inside bubbles and float along to their destination and sometimes they take the
                    shapeshifted form of an otter. They come out in hordes on the full moon, dancing and playing in the
                    moonlight reflected on the water.

                <p class="set-text-font">Originally a Greek type of tree fairy. But truly their presence is worldwide.
                    If you listen to the trees blowing in the breeze, you’ll hear their whispers. Dryads appear as pure
                    whisps of light that dart from tree-top to tree-top. Dryads may be the spirits who gave the name to
                    the Celtic priesthood, Druids.
